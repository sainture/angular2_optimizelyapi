# angular2_optimizelyapi
AngularJS 2 App that pulls in data from Optimizely API

This app is running using Dummy data which is stored in a local variable. The code for getting data from Optimizely REST API is implemented but not used 
because API requires Tokens which is confidential information that I cannot paste in a github project.
