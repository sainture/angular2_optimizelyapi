# LiveView - An AngularJS 2 app to see Live results of Optimizely experiments using its REST API

This app is created with the purpose of displaying it on a Television to see the Live results of Optimizely running experiments and that's why it doesn't offer any interaction.
At this moment, it refreshes after every 10 sec and shows experiments for only two mock clients.

Note: Since the actual Optimizely API call requires Tokens (which is a confidential information), this app is using mock data stored in a local variable.
The code for the API calls is implemented but just not used.
